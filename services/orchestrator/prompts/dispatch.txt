You're dispatching an idea to FULLSEND for experiment design.

## The Idea
{{idea}}

## Context to Include
- Relevant learnings: {{relevant_learnings}}
- Similar past experiments: {{similar_experiments}}
- Available tools: {{tools}}
- Constraints: {{constraints}}

Write a natural language message to FULLSEND explaining:
1. What we want to test
2. Why we think it might work (based on learnings)
3. Any tools already available
4. Any constraints or preferences

Keep it conversational. FULLSEND is an LLM, not a rigid API.
