# Experiment Request

No request pending

<!--
FULLSEND Request Format
=======================
Orchestrator writes requests here. When a request is present, replace
"No request pending" with the actual request content.

Example format:

## Idea
Scrape GitHub stargazers of anthropic/claude and email CTOs

## Context from Orchestrator
- We have had success with developer-focused outreach
- GitHub-based targeting has worked well before
- We need the github_stargazer_scraper tool (request from Builder if missing)

## Available Tools
- resend_email: Send emails via Resend API
- browserbase: Web scraping

## Output
Write experiment spec to experiments/exp_github_stars.yaml

After FULLSEND processes the request, reset this file to "No request pending"
