      Hi {{first_name}},

      I noticed you starred LangChain a few weeks ago — I'm guessing you're building something with LLMs.

      We're working on a tool that auto-generates API schemas from documentation. Cuts integration time from days to hours when you need to connect external services to your AI workflows.

      Early users are shipping 3x faster. Would love to show you what we've built.

      Got 15 minutes this week?

      P.S. No pitch deck — just a quick demo of something I think you'd find useful.
