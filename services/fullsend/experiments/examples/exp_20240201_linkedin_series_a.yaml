      Hi {{first_name}},

      Congrats on the Series A! Saw the announcement — {{company_name}} is tackling a real problem in {{industry}}.

      Curious how you're thinking about scaling GTM post-raise. Most founders I talk to are stuck between:
      - Hiring SDRs (expensive, slow to ramp)
      - Outsourcing lead gen (inconsistent quality)
      - Building in-house automation (engineering time sink)

      We're building autonomous GTM agents that handle the entire top-of-funnel. Currently in early access with a few Series A companies.

      Worth a quick chat to see if it fits your scaling plans?
