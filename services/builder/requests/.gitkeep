# Builder Requests Directory
#
# This directory holds incoming PRDs for Builder to process.
#
# Usage:
#   - Place a PRD as `current_prd.yaml` for Builder to build
#   - See `prd_template.yaml` for the expected format
#   - When Builder processes a PRD, it builds the tool and commits
#   - Safe default behavior when no PRD is present (Builder exits gracefully)
