    orchestrator_reasoning: FULLSEND completed experiment design for CTO competitor-repo
      targeting, but it's blocked pending an email_sender tool which doesn't exist
      yet. The experiment is ready to execute but can't without email capability.
      This is the critical path blocker - we have the strategy (github_stargazer_scraper
      to find CTOs) but no way to reach them. Building email_sender unblocks this
      experiment and will be reusable for all future outreach experiments.
